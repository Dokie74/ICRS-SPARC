# ICRS SPARC Data Import Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for importing and managing data in the ICRS SPARC system.

## Prerequisites

1. Run the database migration first:
   ```bash
   # Run this from the main project directory
   supabase db migrate up
   ```

2. Make sure you have a valid customer ID to assign the imported records to:
   ```bash
   # You can check existing customers in your database
   # The customer ID will be used for all imported preadmissions
   ```

## Preadmissions Import

Import your existing FTZ tracking spreadsheet data into ICRS SPARC.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to scripts directory
cd scripts

# 2. Install dependencies (one time only)
npm install

# 3. Preview import (dry run)
node import-preadmissions-spreadsheet.js "C:\path\to\your\Copy-FTZ_Tracking_worksheet_09032025.xlsx" --customer-id 1 --dry-run --verbose

# 4. Run actual import
node import-preadmissions-spreadsheet.js "C:\path\to\your\Copy-FTZ_Tracking_worksheet_09032025.xlsx" --customer-id 1 --verbose
```

### Command Options

- `--customer-id ID` - Required. Customer ID to assign to all imported records
- `--dry-run` - Preview import without making changes
- `--verbose` - Show detailed progress information
- `--help` - Show help message

### Field Mapping

The script automatically maps your spreadsheet columns to database fields:

|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| UID | admission_id | Unique admission identifier |
| Status | zone_status | FTZ status (NPF/PF/D/ZR) |

| BOL Number | bol | BOL number |
| Container ID | container_number | Container identifier |
| Seal # | seal_number | Container seal number |
| FTZ Admission Date | import_date | FTZ admission date |
| LUC Ship Date | luc_ship_date | Last use ship date |
| Value of Goods | total_value | Total value in USD |
| Bond | bond_amount | Bond amount in USD |
| Tariff $ | total_charges | Tariff charges in USD |
| USCBP Master Bill # | uscbp_master_billing | Master bill number |
| Part ID | part_id | Part identifier (creates items) |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File not found**: Make sure the Excel file path is correct and in quotes
2. **Customer ID required**: You must specify a valid customer ID with `--customer-id`
3. **Duplicates**: The script will skip records with duplicate admission IDs
4. **Column headers**: Make sure your spreadsheet has the expected column headers

### Getting Customer ID

You can check existing customers in your database:
```sql
SELECT id, name FROM customers WHERE active = true;
```

Or create a new customer if needed through the ICRS SPARC interface.

## Next Steps

After importing:
1. Verify the imported data in the PreAdmissions page
2. Check for any records that need manual review
3. Update supplier mappings if needed
4. Run data validation checks
