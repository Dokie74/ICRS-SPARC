# Service Transfer Log - ICRS to SPARC Migration

This document tracks the systematic transfer of business logic services from the original ICRS system to the new SPARC backend architecture.

## Transfer Pattern Established

### Service Architecture
- **Original**: Frontend service classes using direct Supabase client
- **SPARC**: Backend services extending BaseService with database abstraction
- **Response Pattern**: Maintained `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }`
- **RLS Integration**: Preserved Row Level Security with user context
- **Audit Trails**: Enhanced with comprehensive logging for FTZ compliance

### Transfer Process
1. **Analyze Original Service**: Review business logic, methods, and patterns
2. **Create Backend Service**: Extend BaseService with all transferred methods
3. **Add JSDoc Documentation**: Comprehensive method documentation
4. **Create API Routes**: REST endpoints exposing service methods
5. **Maintain Compatibility**: Preserve response formats and behavior
6. **Enhance Security**: Add server-side validation and authorization
