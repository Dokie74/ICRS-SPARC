## Technical Dependencies & Integration Points

### Database Schema Dependencies
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for multi-tenant data access
- **UUID-based primary keys** across all major tables
- **Foreign key constraints** between inventory_lots → parts, customers, locations
- **JSON columns** for complex data (preadmission items, audit photos)
- **Computed columns** for inventory quantities from transaction history

### Critical Integration Points
1. **Supabase Real-time Subscriptions** - Used for live inventory updates
2. **File Storage** - Document uploads, photos, manifests in Supabase Storage
3. **RPC Functions** - Complex calculations performed in PostgreSQL
4. **External APIs** - SHSPI pricing data, USITC tariff updates, ACE filing

### Business Logic Patterns to Preserve
1. **Service Response Pattern:** `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }`
2. **Transaction-based Calculations:** All quantities derived from transaction history
3. **Audit Trail Pattern:** Every business action logged with user, timestamp, details
4. **Status Machine Pattern:** Defined state transitions with validation rules
5. **Permission Caching:** Reduced API calls through intelligent caching

## Key Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- **Dashboard loads** must complete in <2 seconds with 1000+ inventory lots
- **Real-time updates** for inventory changes across multiple users
- **Batch processing** for quarterly pricing updates (1000+ parts)
- **Large dataset handling** for HTS browser (40MB+ tariff data)

### Security Requirements
- **Role-based access control** (admin, manager, warehouse_staff)
- **Row-level security** for multi-customer data isolation
- **Audit logging** for all business transactions
- **Input sanitization** and validation at service layer

### Regulatory Compliance
- **CBP filing requirements** for FTZ Type 06 entries
- **Audit trail preservation** for 7+ years regulatory retention
- **Data integrity** for customs documentation
- **Change tracking** for pricing and inventory adjustments

## Data Migration Considerations

### Critical Data Entities (12 Core Tables)
1. **inventory_lots** - 152K+ total value across active lots
2. **parts** - Master data with material classifications
3. **preadmissions** - Customs workflow documents
4. **preshipments** - Outbound shipping records
5. **transactions** - Complete audit trail of inventory movements
6. **customers** - Customer/consignee master data
7. **employees** - User accounts with role assignments
8. **storage_locations** - Hierarchical warehouse structure
9. **material_indices** - SHSPI pricing history
10. **entry_summaries** - CBP filing records
11. **parts** - Component master with HTS classifications
12. **suppliers** - Manufacturer/supplier master data

### Schema Compatibility Issues
- **Legacy quantity fields** - Current system supports both `current_quantity` and calculated quantities
- **Date format handling** - ISO 8601 timestamps vs. date-only fields
- **JSON structure** - Complex nested objects in preadmission items, audit data
- **Foreign key relationships** - Ensure referential integrity during migration

## Next Steps for Systematic Transfer

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Set up SPARC backend structure** following identified service patterns
2. **Create database migration scripts** for schema transfer
3. **Implement base service layer** with CRUD operations and response patterns
4. **Set up authentication framework** with role-based permissions

### Week 1 Deliverables
- [ ] Base service infrastructure in SPARC
- [ ] Database connection and basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Authentication service with role management
- [ ] User service with employee profile management

### Week 2-3 Deliverables (Core Business Logic)
- [ ] Inventory service with transaction-based calculations
- [ ] Preadmission service with customs workflow
- [ ] Preshipment service with entry summary creation
- [ ] Part and customer master data services
